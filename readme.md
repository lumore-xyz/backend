Each user have **10 free conversation daily**

### What they will see and what they won’t?

You find a match, nice. you can start the conversation, send your “Hi 👋”, but wait are you concern about your profile data, you don’t want to show your profile or photos to a random stranger. we got your point. You can choose what to show and what not to on your profile, you can provide the data for better match making. and once you feel comfortable to show your profile you can just **“UNLOCK YOUR PROFILE”**. By unlocking your profile, your partner can also see your profile.

### Thinking That you found the guy / lady?

Don’t risk it, Save your chat into a slot. slots are limited and can be bought, now you can chat with that person anytime you want. if they are offline you can still use the random chat. and if you feel the conversation is not going well, you can end the conversation with a constructive criticism (anything they did wrong or they can improve) or by reporting them (We take reporting really seriously).

If everything went well, Congratulation go for a date. If something went wrong like scam or something, you can check out your recent matches list in your profile page, and make sure you report them, we will make sure they can never use the app again. even if they payed for premium
